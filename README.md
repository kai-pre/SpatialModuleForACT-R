# Spatial Module for ACT-R

The spatial module extends ACT-R's modular structure by a dedicated processing unit for mental spatial transformations. The idea is to offer functionality for processing three-dimensional data in ACT-R in a cognitively plausible fashion. The module presented herein avoids episodic and allocentric buffers, as the mechanisms underlying these additional buffers are already supplied by ACT-R's default modules, namely the declarative and visual/imaginal modules.
The spatial module aims to offer better explainability, applicability and validity for cognitive models of spatial cognition by offering explanations for commonly shown effects such as differences in spatial strategies or increased solving time for higher task difficulties, supporting multiple paradigms of mental spatial cognition research such as mental rotation or mental folding, and offering a common framework for these mechanisms, thus bypassing the need for overly specific modeling approaches.
